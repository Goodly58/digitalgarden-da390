# W1
**Software Development Life Cycle**
- Requirements (what software will do) [specification]
- Design (sketching models)  [design and implementation]
- Coding [design and implementation]
- Testing [validation]
- Maintenance [evolution]

**SDLC Models**
- Waterfall model
- Agile model
- OO model

**Control structures** (flow of execution)
1. Sequential (line by line)
2. Condition (if, else, switch)
3. Repetition (for, while)

**Software project failure**
- Complex code
- Bad approach (not using SDLC)

**"Software"?** Program for customer/market.
**Software engineering?** discipline for developing software
**SE vs comp sci?** comp sci: theoretical. SE: practical.
**SE costs?** 60% development 40% testing ⭐
**SE ethics?** no plagiarism (copyright), no computer misuse, keep company code secret
~~**best SE method?** Depends on system.~~


**Generic product?** any customer.
**Customized product?** commissioned by specific customer.

**SE activities?** ⭐ 
- specification (requirements)
- development (design, coding)
- validation (testing)
- evolution (maintenance)

**Good software?** ⭐ 
- maintability (written in way you can update)
- security (reliable, safe)
- efficiency (memory, runtime)
- acceptability (user friendly)

**SE challenges?** ⭐
-  meeting heterogeneity (portability) demands
-  adapting to social/business changes
-  security
-  scale (small vs large software)

**Application types** ⭐ 
1. **standalone**: run locally (ex. calculator). no need for internet.
2. **interactive**: run remotely (ex. shopping). needs internet. client-server.
3. **embedded**: built into hardware (ex. printer, drones). controls device.
4. **batch**: process large data at once (ex. bank statements).
5. **entertainment**: fun (ex. games, netflix)
6. **modeling/simulation:** test scenario (ex. flight sim)
7. **data collection:** data from environment (ex. weather station)
8. **system of systems:** multiple systems (ex. smart city system — traffic, transport, etc.) 

ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics: guide behavior of software engineers
WHY? engineers can help/harm society through software.


**Activity Diagram**

Requirements:
- Functional: "**The system shall** collect patient data"
- Non-function: "**The system shall** handle 10 transmissions per hour" 

Client-server architecture

Primary stakeholders: directly interact in software (clients)
Secondary stakeholders: impacted by software (public)
