> [!info]- questions written down
> **Q1. The effectiveness of an SVM depends upon:**
> A) Selection of Kernel B) gamma parameter C) Soft Margin Parameter C D) All of the above
> **Q2. The SVM's are less effective when:**
> A) The data is linearly separable B) The data is clean and ready to use C) The data is noisy and contains overlapping points
> **Q3. Suppose you are using RBF kernel in SVM with high Gamma value. What does this signify?**
> A) The model would consider even far away points from hyperplane for modeling B) The model would consider only the points close to the hyperplane for modeling C) The model would not be affected by distance of points from hyperplane for modeling D) None of the above
> **Q4. What would happen when you use very small C (C~0)?**
> A) Misclassification would happen B) Data will be correctly classified C) This has no effect on the classification correctness D) None of these
> **Q5. Suppose you are using a Linear SVM classifier with a binary classification problem as in the figure below.**
