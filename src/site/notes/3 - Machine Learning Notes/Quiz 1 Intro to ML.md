### **Q1**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Grouping students into two groups: females and males, using their student information available on Banner.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Classification**  
> Because the groups (female, male) are **predefined labels** → this is a **supervised task**, not unsupervised clustering.

---

### **Q2**

**True/False**  
Semi-supervised learning can be used with regression tasks.

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ❌ **False**  
> Semi-supervised learning typically applies to **classification** problems where part of the data is labeled, not regression.

---

### **Q3**

Which of the following is true:

A. Machine Learning is broader than Artificial Intelligence.  
B. **Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.**  
C. Artificial Intelligence is a subset of Deep Learning.  
D. Data Mining and Machine Learning are identical.  
E. All the above.

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **B. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.**  
> Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning based on neural networks.

---

### **Q4**

Fill in the blank:  
In _______ learning, the training data includes both inputs and known outputs.

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Supervised**  
> Because supervised learning uses labeled data with both input features and target outputs.

---

### **Q5**

**True/False**  
Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when labeled data is abundant, but unlabeled data is rare.

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ❌ **False**  
> Semi-supervised learning is useful when **labeled data is scarce** but **unlabeled data is abundant**.

---

### **Q6**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Grouping those who are satisfied with a purchase based on their reviews.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Classification**  
> Because satisfaction (“satisfied” vs. “not satisfied”) is a **labeled** category → a supervised classification task.

---

### **Q7**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Monitoring the level of vibration and temperature of a machine and predicting if the machine will fail or not.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Classification**  
> Because the output (“fail” or “not fail”) is a **binary label**, so it’s a **classification problem**, not regression.

---

### **Q8**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Grouping customers based on their purchasing patterns.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Clustering**  
> Because we’re discovering natural **groups** in unlabeled data → **unsupervised learning**.

---

### **Q9**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Identifying which courses students often enroll in together to improve course offering planning.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Association Rule Mining**  
> Because this discovers **relationships** or **co-occurrence patterns** between items (like “students who take X often take Y”).

---

### **Q10**

Determine whether the following activity is a machine learning and data mining task or not.  
If it is a machine learning and data mining task, indicate if it uses classification, regression, clustering, or association rule mining.

**Estimating a future’s value of a building based on information about other buildings in the area.**

A. Clustering  
B. Classification  
C. Regression  
D. Association Rule Mining  
E. Not a machine learning or data mining task

> [!success]- 💡 **Solution**  
> ✅ **Regression**  
> Because the goal is to predict a **continuous numeric value** (building price/value).
